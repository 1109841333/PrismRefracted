#Prism

Grief Reversal Mastery for all.

Prism isn't just another (BigBrother, LogBlock, Hawkeye, CoreProtect). Prism is the ultimate grief/world change management plugin for Bukkit servers.

Prism's search parameters are incredibly powerful but won't let you get away with accidentally rolling back a week of work because of a typo.

Prism makes it incredibly easy to figure out what happened, when, and who is responsible.

Prism's in-game chat messages are beautifully-designed. Prism realizes that you're a human being, chat is busy, and you don't us getting in the way. Messages are extremely clean, consistent, and never spam the chat.

Prism offers a multitude of search tools, a way to preview your changes before anything in the world is affected. Prism supports almost every event you would need to track - block changes, entity kills (you can even rollback entity kills), and MANY more.

Prism was designed for busy servers and is *extremely* fast. The Prism database was designed to optimize for millions of records without using unnecessary disk space, and to still return query results in record time.
