#Prism

*An incredible plugin for rollbacks, restores, and more. *

Prism is a new generation of grief management (rollbacks, restores, etc) plugin for your Bukkit server. It's designed to be extremely fast and incredibly powerful - smarter rollbacks combined with tons of features that put Prism in a class of it's own.

Prism not only offers the standard features you expect, but a **lot** more.
